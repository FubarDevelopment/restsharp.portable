# Changes

## 4.0.8

* Fix for [issue #95](https://github.com/FubarDevelopment/restsharp.portable/issues/95): The Xamarin platform supports all those additonal `HttpWebRequest` properties

## 4.0.7

* Fix for [issue #90](https://github.com/FubarDevelopment/restsharp.portable/issues/90): Build was not optimized and therefore detected as `DEBUG` build when publishing with a UWP app

## 4.0.6

* Fix for [issue #89](https://github.com/FubarDevelopment/restsharp.portable/issues/89): The content type is now used as body name when none was specified
* Fix for [issue #88](https://github.com/FubarDevelopment/restsharp.portable/issues/88): Build especially for the Xamarin platforms
* Fix for [issue #85](https://github.com/FubarDevelopment/restsharp.portable/issues/85): You can now get cookies from a `IRestResponse`
* Fix for [issue #84](https://github.com/FubarDevelopment/restsharp.portable/issues/84): OAuth1 authenticator ignores parameters without name
* Fix for [issue #76](https://github.com/FubarDevelopment/restsharp.portable/issues/76): Support for streamed results is finally there

## 4.0.0

### New features

* Support for `netstandard1.0` and above
* Support for `HMAC-SHA256`

### Breaking changes

* OAuth 1.0 Package renamed to FubarCoder.RestSharp.Portable.OAuth1
* The `AddHandler`, `RemoveHandler`, `ClearHandlers` replaced by `ContentHandlers` dictionary
* The `AddEncoding`, `RemoveEncoding`, `ClearEncodings` replaced by `EncodingHandlers` dictionary
* `IRequestProxy` removed. We're now using `IWebProxy`. The `Proxy` property doesn't exist any more on unsupported platforms
* The same parameter is allowed multiple times. You can use the `AddOrUpdate*` functions when you only want to have one parameter with the same name
* `GetOrPost` and `QueryString` parameters are different - even when issuing a GET request

### Probably breaking Changes

* `GetOrPost` parameters are sent as `x-www-form-urlencoded` when the request method is **not** `GET`

## 3.3.0

This is a backport of changes from the 4.0 branch.

### Possible breaking changes

* Fix for [issue #71](https://github.com/FubarDevelopment/restsharp.portable/issues/71): Support to send multiple parameters with the same name. You can use `AddOrUpdate` when every named parameter must occur only once. There is no `ParameterComparer` any more. The `Parameters` and `DefaultParameters` properties are now a `IPropertyCollection` which is derived from `ICollection<Parameter>`, and **not** an `IList<Parameter>` any more!
* Fix for [issue #69](https://github.com/FubarDevelopment/restsharp.portable/issues/69): `GetOrPost` parameters are sent as `x-www-form-urlencoded` when the request method is **not** `GET`.

## 3.2.0

* New `Content` property for `IRestResponse`
* Updated Android targets to 4.0.3 (due to 2.3.3 SDK not being installable)

## 3.1.3

* Fix for [issue #57](https://github.com/FubarDevelopment/restsharp.portable/issues/57) (thanks to zevsst)
* Fix for [issue #55](https://github.com/FubarDevelopment/restsharp.portable/issues/55)

## 3.1.0

This is the final release for version 3. Be aware that version 3.1 contains many **breaking changes**:

* The `IRestRequest.Credentials` property moved to `IRestClient.Credentials`
* Credentials for authenticators are specified using the `IRestClient.Credentials` property
* New core library that contains all interfaces and other generic stuff
* New interface for proxies
* New interfaces that are an abstraction of the HttpClient and its request/response messages
* Uses now a RestSharp project compatible Method enumeration for HTTP requests
* Support for WebRequest as back-end for RestSharp.Portable

## 3.0.0 beta 12

* A special URL encoding is required for query parameters used to calculate
  the OAuth 1.0 signature - fixes sending a URL as Twitter status

## 3.0.0 beta 11

* Async locking fixes (provided by [evnik](https://github.com/evnik))
* OAuth 1.0 fixes (required for Twitter)
  * UTF-8 encoding for characters like `\u2764\uFE0F` (❤️)

## 3.0.0 beta 09

Fix endless loop for OAuth2 and failed requests when a refresh token is available.

## 3.0.0 beta 07

Remember the OAuth2 refresh token when calling the `GetCurrentToken` function with a set
refresh token. This should fix the problem with exiring access tokens.

* Use the JetBrains.Annotations assembly to fix problems when creating CoreCLR assemblies
  that want to use JetBrains.Annotations too

* Make all assemblies containing WebRequest implementations signed

## 3.0.0 alpha 5-8

* Added RestSharp implementation using WebRequest instead of HttpClient
* Added PCL optimizations (for .NET 4.5 and up)

## 3.0.0 alpha 4

  that doesn't have any dependencies

  request/response messages

  all constructors taking a HttpMethod are flagged as obsolete
* The IAuthenticator, ISerializer, IEncoding, and IDeserializer interfaces were
  moved to the RestSharp.Portable namespace

## 3.0.0 alpha 3

* Revamped authenticator interfaces
  * Provide a way to process the `Www-Authenticate` header
  * Make HTTP Basic/Digest authenticators work with `Proxy-Authenticate` header
  * Credentials property moved from `IRestRequest` to `IRestClient`
  * The NTLM authenticator is not needed anymore, because the the credentials from 
    the `IRestRequest` are automatically used in the `HttpClientHandler` which handles
    the Basic/Digest/NTLM authentication automatically
  * All authenticators should query the credentials passed to the authenticator
  * New `AuthenticationChallengeHandler` which selects one of the registered
    authenticators in response to a `Www-Authenticate` or `Proxy-Authenticate` challenge.
